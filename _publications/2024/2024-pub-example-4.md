  This study introduces "Multi-modal Multi-task Network" (3MT-Net), a deep learning architecture using clinical data, B-mode, and color Doppler ultrasound. 3MT-Net employs AM-CapsNet for tumor feature extraction, cross-attention for data fusion, and ensemble learning for optimization. Extensive testing on two datasets showed 3MT-Net outperforms the industrial-grade CAD product S-detect, achieving higher AUC.
