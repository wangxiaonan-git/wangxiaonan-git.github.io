  We introduce Med-MAT, a VQA dataset comprising 106 open-source medical datasets designed to advance generalization experiments and support the training of powerful medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This dataset highlights Compositional Generalization (CG) as a key mechanism, enabling MLLMs to better understand unseen images and achieve more data-efficient training.
