short_bio: >-
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at Yonsei University, supervised by Professor Hansaem Kim.<br/><br/>
  I currently work at the Korean Data and Language Resource Center. My research focuses on developing evaluation benchmarks for multimodal and multilingual language models, with an emphasis on model safety.<br/><br/>
  I am particularly interested in how language models perform across different languages and cultures, and how evaluation can promote their adaptability, accuracy, and safety.<br/><br/>
  By combining linguistics and AI, I aim to build reliable and inclusive benchmarks that reflect the complexities of real-world language use.
