short_bio: >-
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at Yonsei University, supervised by Professor Hansaem Kim and I am currently working at the Korean Data and Language Resource Center. My research primarily revolves around the development of evaluation benchmarks for multimodal language models, multilingual language models, and the security of language models. I am particularly interested in investigating how these models perform in different languages and cultures, and how they can be evaluated in ways that enhance their adaptability, accuracy, and safety. By combining linguistics and AI, my work aims to create more reliable and fair benchmarks that reflect the complexities of diverse linguistic and social contexts. Through this research, I hope to contribute to the advancement of more secure, adaptable, and inclusive AI systems.
