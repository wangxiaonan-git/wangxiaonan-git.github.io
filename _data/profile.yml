  I am Rongsheng Wang, I used to study at Macao Polytechnic University (MPU) and work under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=lLg3WRkAAAAJ">Tao Tan</a>. My research interests are LLM, and MLLMs. I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity. </br></br>I publish a lot of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng">🔗Github</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/wangrongsheng?style=flat-square">. I have served as a core developer on projects such as <a href="https://github.com/kaixindelele/ChatPaper/stargazers" target="_blank">ChatPaper<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kaixindelele/ChatPaper?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM/stargazers" target="_blank">XrayGLM<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses/stargazers" target="_blank">Awesome-LLM-Resources<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek/stargazers" target="_blank">TinyDeepSeek<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>.

I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">🔗Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.
